/**
 * @file
 * This theme utilises Susy - a powerful/flexible utility grid.
 *
 * Susy is not used as the sites main frame as Bootstrap handles this.
 * Bootstrap is chosen as the mainframe to provide the option to site builders
 * to apply Bootstrap classes such as col-md-* to custom blocks/elements etc.
 * Susy is useful when we need close control of elements such as _slat layout
 * or when we need gallery style layouts of variable items. (Bootstrap requires
 * an empty clearing div to achieve gallery style layouts).
 *
 * 1. Here we establish our Susy defaults
 *    http://www.zell-weekeat.com/susy2-tutorial/
 *    http://susy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/toolkit/
 *
 * 2. Uses Bootstrap gutter variable for consistent gutters

Plain text module

Probably needs a better name..

This module creates a checkbox at  at /admin/config/content/formats/manage/{format}.
If this checkbox is ticked then all text pasted in the ckeditor using this text
format will have all formatting stripped.

This retains the integrity of the Paste from word toolbar button.
